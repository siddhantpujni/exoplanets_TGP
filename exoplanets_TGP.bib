  abstract = {We present K2SC (K2 Systematics Correction), a Python pipeline to model instrumental systematics and astrophysical variability in light curves from the K2 mission. K2SC uses Gaussian process regression to model position-dependent systematics and time-dependent variability simultaneously, enabling the user to remove both (e.g., for transit searches) or to remove systematics while preserving variability (for variability studies). For periodic variables, K2SC automatically computes estimates of the period, amplitude and evolution timescale of the variability. We apply K2SC to publicly available K2 data from campaigns 3--5, showing that we obtain photometric precision approaching that of the original Kepler mission. We compare our results to other publicly available K2 pipelines, showing that we obtain similar or better results, on average. We use transit injection and recovery tests to evaluate the impact of K2SC on planetary transit searches in K2 PDC (Pre-search Data Conditioning) data, for planet-to-star radius ratios down Rp/Rstar = 0.01 and periods up to P = 40 d, and show that K2SC significantly improves the ability to distinguish between correct and false detections, particularly for small planets. K2SC can be run automatically on many light curves, or manually tailored for specific objects such as pulsating stars or large amplitude eclipsing binaries. It can be run on ASCII and FITS light curve files, regardless of their origin. Both the code and the processed light curves are publicly available, and we provide instructions for downloading and using them. The methodology used by K2SC will be applicable to future transit search missions such as TESS and PLATO.},

WASP-45b is a 1.03-MJup planet which passes in front of the limb of its K2V host star every 3.13 days. Weak Ca{$\quad$}ii H\&amp;K emission seen in the spectra of WASP-45 suggests that the star is chromospherically active. WASP-46b is a 2.10-MJup planet in a 1.43-day orbit around a G6V star. Rotational modulation of the light curves of WASP-46 and weak Ca{$\quad$}ii H\&amp;K emission in its spectra show the star to be photospherically and chromospherically active.We imposed circular orbits in our analyses as the radial-velocity data are consistent with (near-)circular orbits, as could be expected from both empirical and tidal-theory perspectives for such short-period, {$\sim$}Jupiter-mass planets. We discuss the impact of fitting for eccentric orbits for such planets when not supported by the data. The derived planetary and stellar radii depend on the fitted eccentricity and these parameters inform intense theoretical efforts concerning tidal circularization and heating, bulk planetary composition and the observed systematic errors in planetary and stellar radii. As such, we recommend exercising caution in fitting the orbits of short-period, {$\sim$}Jupiter-mass planets with an eccentric model when there is no evidence of non-circularity.},

  abstract = {A new non-linear limb-darkening law, based on the Least-Squares Method (LSM), is presented. This law is able to describe the intensity distribution much more accurately than any of the old ones given that the differences I(model)-I(fitting) are of some order of magnitude smaller than those derived from other approximations. This new law shows several advantages: it represents well the intensity distribution, the flux is conserved with high accuracy and it permits the use of a single law for the whole HR Diagram since the bi-parametric laws are only marginally valid in certain ranges of effective temperatures. The limb-darkening coefficients are computed for the 12 commonly used photometric bands u v b y U B V R I J H K. Bolometric and monochromatic calculations are also available. The computations are presented for 19 metallicities ranging from 10-5 up to 10+1 solar abundances, with log g varying between 0 and 5.0 and effective temperatures between 2000 K-50000 K. Results for microturbulent velocities of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 km/s are also available. With this set of data it was possible to investigate, for the first time, the influence of such parameters in the limb-darkening. Limb-brightening, instead of limb-darkening, was detected for some models. It is shown that the limb-darkening coefficients derived using the Flux Conservation Method (FCM) do not describe very well the intensity distribution, mainly near the border of the disk. On the contrary, the present coefficients, based on the LSM, represent very well the function I({$\mu$}) at any part of the disk for any filter or wavelength, log g, effective temperature, metallicity and microturbulent velocity. The results are presented in 46 tables for the 12 filters (bolometric) and can be retrieved from the CDS. Due to the size of the remaining tables, mainly the monochromatic, these are available only on request (CD ROMs). Tables 1-47 are available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Abstract.html.

  abstract = {One of the main endeavors of the field of exoplanetary sciences is the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres on a population level. The current method of choice to accomplish this task is transmission spectroscopy, where the apparent radius of a transiting exoplanet is measured at multiple wavelengths in search of atomic and molecular absorption features produced by the upper atmosphere constituents. To extract the planetary radius from a transit light curve, it is necessary to account for the decrease in luminosity away from the center of the projected stellar disk, known as the limb darkening. Physically-motivated parametrizations of the limb darkening, in particular of the quadratic form, are commonly used in exoplanet transit light-curve fitting. Here, we show that such parametrizations can introduce significant wavelength-dependent biases in the transmission spectra currently obtained with all instrument modes of the JWST, and thus have the potential to affect atmospheric inferences. To avoid such biases, we recommend the use of standard limb-darkening parametrizations with wide uninformative priors that allow for non-physical stellar intensity profiles in the transit fits, and thus for a complete and symmetrical exploration of the parameter space. We further find that fitting the light curves at the native resolution results in errors on the measured transit depths that are significantly smaller compared to light curves that are binned in wavelength before fitting, thus potentially maximizing the amount of information that can be extracted from the data.},

  abstract = {Stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements have proven to be a very successful method for detecting extrasolar planets. Analysing RV data to determine the parameters of the extrasolar planets is a significant statistical challenge owing to the presence of multiple planets and various degeneracies between orbital parameters. Determining the number of planets favoured by the observed data is an even more difficult task. Bayesian model selection provides a mathematically rigorous solution to this problem by calculating marginal posterior probabilities of models with different number of planets, but the use of this method in extrasolar planetary searches has been hampered by the computational cost of the evaluating Bayesian evidence. None the less, Bayesian model selection has the potential to improve the interpretation of existing observational data and possibly detect yet undiscovered planets. We present a new and efficient Bayesian method for determining the number of extrasolar planets, as well as for inferring their orbital parameters, without having to calculate directly the Bayesian evidence for models containing a large number of planets. Instead, we work iteratively and at each iteration obtain a conservative lower limit on the odds ratio for the inclusion of an additional planet into the model. We apply this method to simulated data sets containing one and two planets and successfully recover the correct number of planets and reliable constraints on the orbital parameters. We also apply our method to RV measurements of HD 37124, 47 Ursae Majoris and HD 10180. For HD 37124, we confirm that the current data strongly favour a three-planet system. We find strong evidence for the presence of a fourth planet in 47 Ursae Majoris, but its orbital period is suspiciously close to 1 yr, casting doubt on its validity. For HD 10180 we find strong evidence for a six-planet system.},

  abstract = {Ralph Henstock (1923 - 2007) worked in non-absolute integration, including the Riemann-complete or gauge integral which, independently, Jaroslav Kurzweil also discovered in the 1950's. As a Cambridge undergraduate Henstock took a course of lectures, by J.C. Burkill, on the integration of interval functions. Later, under the supervision of Paul Dienes in Birkbeck College, London, he undertook research into the ideas of Burkill (interval function integrands) and Dienes (Stieltjes integrands); and he presented this thesis in December 1948. The thesis contains the germ of Henstock's later work, in terms of overall approach and methods of proof. For example, a notable innovation is a set of axioms for constructing any particular system of integration. This highlights the features held in common by various systems, so that a particular property or theorem can, by a single, common proof, be shown to hold for various kinds of integration. Within this approach, Henstock's thesis places particular emphasis on various alternative ways of selecting Riemann sums, as the primary distinguishing feature of different systems of integration. This idea was central to his subsequent work and achievement. Of interest also are those ideas in the thesis which were effectively abandoned in his subsequent work. In addition to Henstock's own insights at that stage of his work, this thesis provides a good overview of the literature and state of knowledge of integration of the non-Lebesgue kind at that time. These are good enough reasons for transcribing the thesis. Another pressing reason is that the ink and paper of the near 70 years old copy of the thesis in the Archive in the University of Ulster Library in Coleraine (Henstock's personal, annotated copy) are showing signs of deterioration.

Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

  abstract = {When we are fortunate enough to view an exoplanetary system nearly edge-on, the star and planet periodically eclipse each other. Observations of eclipses (transits and occultations) provide a bonanza of information that cannot be obtained from radial-velocity data alone, such as the relative dimensions of the planet and its host star, as well as the orientation of the planet's orbit relative to the sky plane and relative to the stellar rotation axis. The wavelength-dependence of the eclipse signal gives clues about the the temperature and composition of the planetary atmosphere. Anomalies in the timing or other properties of the eclipses may betray the presence of additional planets or moons. Searching for eclipses is also a productive means of discovering new planets. This chapter reviews the basic geometry and physics of eclipses, and summarizes the knowledge that has been gained through eclipse observations, as well as the information that might be gained in the future.},
