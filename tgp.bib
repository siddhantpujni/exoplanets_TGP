  abstract = {We present a new, simple method to predict activity-induced radial velocity (RV) variations using high-precision time series photometry. It is based on insights from a simple spot model, has only two free parameters (one of which can be estimated from the light curve) and does not require knowledge of the stellar rotation period. We test the method on simulated data and illustrate its performance by applying it to MOST/SOPHIE observations of the planet host star HD 189733, where it gives almost identical results to much more sophisticated but highly degenerate models, and synthetic data for the Sun, where we demonstrate that it can reproduce variations well below the m s-1 level. We also apply it to quarter 1 data for Kepler transit candidate host stars, where it can be used to estimate RV variations down to the 2--3 m s-1 level, and show that RV amplitudes above that level may be expected for approximately two-thirds of the candidates we examined.},

  abstract = {Methods. We developed an integrated tool called MCMCI. This tool combines the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach of analysing photometric or radial velocity time series with a proper interpolation within stellar evolutionary isochrones and tracks, known as isochrone placement, to be performed at each chain step, to retrieve stellar theoretical parameters such as age, mass, and radius. Results. We tested the MCMCI on the HD 219134 multi-planetary system hosting two transiting rocky super Earths and on WASP-4, which hosts a bloated hot Jupiter. Even considering different input approaches, a final convergence was reached within the code, we found good agreement with the results already stated in the literature and we obtained more precise output parameters, especially concerning planetary masses. Conclusions. The MCMCI tool offers the opportunity to perform an integrated analysis of an exoplanetary system without splitting it into the preliminary stellar characterisation through theoretical models. Rather this approach favours a close interaction between light curve analysis and isochrones, so that the parameters recovered at each step of the MCMC enter as inputs for purposes of isochrone placement.},

The procedures are proved analytically, and examples from current problems in astronomy are discussed.},

  abstract = {We analyse 11 years of precise radial velocities for 76 solar type stars from the Lick survey. Eight stars in this sample have previously reported planetary-mass companions, all with mass (m sin i) less than 8 Jupiter masses (MJ). For the stars without a detected companion, we place upper limits on possible companion mass. For most stars, we can exclude companions with m sin i {$>$} 0.7 MJ (a/AU)\textasciicircum 1/2 for orbital radii a {$<$} 5 AU. We use our results to interpret the observed masses and orbital radii of planetary-mass companions. For example, we show that the finite duration of the observations makes detection of Jupiter mass companions more and more difficult for orbital radii beyond 3 AU. Thus it is possible that the majority of solar type stars harbor Jupiter-mass companions much like our own, and if so these companions should be detectable in a few years. To search for periodicities, we adopt a "floating-mean" periodogram, which improves on the traditional Lomb-Scargle periodogram by accounting for statistical fluctuations in the mean of a sampled sinusoid. We discuss in detail the normalization of the periodogram, an issue which has been of some debate in the literature.},

In this primarily pedagogical contribution, we give a brief overview of the most basic MCMC method and some practical advice for the use of MCMC in real inference problems. We give advice on method choice, tuning for performance, methods for initialization, tests of convergence, troubleshooting, and use of the chain output to produce or report parameter estimates with associated uncertainties. We argue that autocorrelation time is the most important test for convergence, as it directly connects to the uncertainty on the sampling estimate of any quantity of interest. We emphasize that sampling is a method for doing integrals; this guides our thinking about how MCMC output is best used.},
